## Hi there 👋

I'm currently working as a development team lead at [Cistec AG](https://www.cistec.com/).

You might have stumbled onto my profile through my [Pacman Canvas](https://pacman.platzh1rsch.ch/).

### GraphQL Federation
Technically I'm playing around with a lot of different things atm, especially looking into architecture things, like federated graphs.
Maybe you'll read some more about this on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@platzh1rsch) someday 🤞.

### BJJ Video Analyzer 🥋
I am also diving into the world of computer vision and machine learning, building [BJJ Video Analyzer](https://bjj-video-analyzer.com/).

### openEHR for health IT
Furthermore, I recently started diving deeper into [openEHR](https://openehr.org/) by building [open-cis](https://github.com/platzhersh/open-cis).

### Support ☕

If you found any of my stuff useful and feel generous, feel free to send some coffee. (I do like coffee ☕️)
