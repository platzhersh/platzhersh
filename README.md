## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as a development team lead at [Cistec AG](https://www.cistec.com/).

You might have stumbled onto my profile through my [Pacman Canvas](https://pacman.platzh1rsch.ch/).

Technically I'm playing around with a lot of different things atm, especially looking into architecture things, like federated graphs.
Maybe you'll read some more about this on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@platzh1rsch) someday ðŸ¤ž.
